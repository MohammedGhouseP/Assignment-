        Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I have designed this space to
        showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. Whether
        you're a recruiter, client, or fellow developer, I hope you find
        something here that sparks your interest. I believe in continuous
        learning, creativity, and building solutions that make an impact. This
        site is built with simplicity in mind, and every section is crafted to
        reflect my journey in tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have worked on various projects ranging from
        static websites to full-stack web applications. I started my journey
        with HTML and CSS, exploring the fundamentals of web design. Slowly, I
        transitioned into JavaScript, which opened the door to making websites
        dynamic and interactive. These experiences laid a strong foundation for
        my current work in React.js, Node.js, and other modern technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my favorite projects is a responsive e-commerce platform where
        users can browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases. I
        implemented user authentication, integrated a payment gateway, and
        managed product data using MongoDB. This project helped me understand
        the complexities of building scalable applications and the importance of
        clean code and modular design.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to development, I also have a keen eye for UI/UX. I use
        tools like Figma to prototype and design interfaces before bringing them
        to life in code. I focus on accessibility and performance to ensure that
        every website I build is inclusive and runs smoothly across all devices
        and browsers. These practices reflect my commitment to delivering a
        great user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration and teamwork have been central to my growth. I've worked
        in both academic and professional environments where I've contributed to
        team projects using Git and GitHub. These experiences have taught me how
        to work effectively in Agile settings, manage tasks with tools like
        Trello and Jira, and communicate technical ideas clearly with teammates.

        I'm constantly learning and staying updated with the latest in web
        development. I frequently take part in online courses, webinars, and
        coding challenges to sharpen my skills. Currently, I’m exploring
        TypeScript, Next.js, and GraphQL to take my full-stack development
        expertise to the next level. I’m also building side projects to
        experiment with new libraries and frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy writing technical blogs to share my learnings
        and help beginners get started. I believe that knowledge should be
        shared, and contributing to the community is something I take seriously.
        You can find my blog posts on platforms like Dev.to or Medium where I
        write about JavaScript concepts, project walkthroughs, and interview
        preparation tips.
      </p>

      <p>
        My academic background in computer science has equipped me with strong
        analytical and problem-solving skills. Courses in data structures,
        algorithms, and database management have played a crucial role in
        shaping the way I approach development problems. I always strive to
        write optimized code and think deeply about performance and scalability.
